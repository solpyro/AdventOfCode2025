# Advent of Code 2025

This year I'll be quick & dirty, writing in JS (not even typescript) and using work's copilot assist.

Use `node {day file}` in the terminal to run a day's solution in VS Code

## Day 1: Secret Entrance ⭐⭐

Of course, day 1, part 1 is simple. 

For part 2, I know I must be double counting somehow, but I can't figure out where. Brute force was fast enough anyway (literally clicking through and checking for 0 each move) even if it feels dirty.

## Day 2: Gift Shop ✨✨

I was overwhelmed by part 1, and turned to Copilot for some help. Considering how hit & miss it is for my _actual_ work, I was surprised by how accurate the response was. given my minimal prompt.

Laziness begets laziness, and I let GPT-4.1 complete the second half as well. Reviewing the code, I understand what it's doing, but I don't think I'd have written it that way myself. For one, I don't know the modern Javascript API that well; my knowledge is almost 5 years old and was firmly reliant on JQuery.

## Day 3: Lobby ✨

I understood the assignment, but I get an AI star because I asked GPT to implement the `maxJoltage` function, based on comments that outlined the algorithm. It was lucky I knew the algorithm, since I had to coach Copilot through almost every step of the implementation.
