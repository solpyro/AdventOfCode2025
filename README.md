# Advent of Code 2025

This year I'll be quick & dirty, writing in JS (not even typescript) and using work's copilot assist.

Use `node {day file}` in the terminal to run a day's solution in VS Code

## Day 1 ⭐⭐

Of course, day 1, part 1 is simple. For part 2, I know I must be double counting somehow, but I can't figure out where. Brute force was fast enough anyway (literally clicking through and checking for 0 each move) even if it feels dirty.
